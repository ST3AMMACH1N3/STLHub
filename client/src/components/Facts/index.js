                <ul>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: STL (Season 1) and Survivor: Tortuga (Season 2) were the only seasons that lasted just two days.  Beginning with Isla de Muerta, Survivor seasons were lengthened to three days.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: At World's End (Season 4) was the first winter Survivor, taking place just after Christmas.  The extremely cold weather brought a whole new spin to the game.  In addition, At World's End was the first Survivor season to feature an ongoing storyline for the Survivors to deal with.  It was also the first Survivor in which tribe selection was predetermined by the Producers.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: Isla de Muerta (Season 3) was the first Survivor in which a player laid down his torch instead of being voted out.  Katie had to leave the game due to a family issue.  She later went on to win Survivor: Serenity (Season 7).</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: Sleepy Hollow (Season 6) was the first "scary" season.  Players not only had to deal with each other, but also had to avoid "losing their heads" as the Headless Horseman terrorized the camps.  Apparently, he did his job a little too well, as an unprecedented five players laid down their torches in fear.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: Serenity (Season 7) featured the most elaborate storyline and the biggest crew to date, with four executive producers, seven actors, and three very frightening Reavers.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: Tortuga (Season 2) was the first season to feature a hidden Immunity Idol.  The Idol was found in the first hour of the game by Kaley, who went on to win.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: Caribbean Sea (Season 5) was the only season to begin with all players in one large tribe.  Later, the tribe was divided into three smaller tribes.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: At World's End (Season 4) was the first time that the jury was made up of nine members instead of seven.  In a surprise twist at the final tribal council, each of the final two Survivors was given the right to cast out the vote of the juror of their choice.  It ended up not making a difference, however, as Tommy would have won whether or not those votes counted.  As of today, the only other season to have a nine-member jury with a Final Two was Survivor: Caribbean Sea (Season 5).   The nine jurors represented the nine Pirate Lords.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: The 10th Kingdom (Season 8) was the first season to offer a Jr. edition for ages 10 - 15.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>During Survivor: The 10th Kingdom (Season 8), Kim was the first Survivor ever to be removed from the game for medical reasons.  She quickly recovered and joined the jury a few hours later. To date, she remains the only player ever to be medically removed from the game.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: The 10th Kingdom (Season 8) was the first season in which the Hidden Immunity Idol was NOT found.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Joey became the first person ever to win TWO Survivors, winning first Survivor: Sleepy Hollow (Season Six) and Survivor: Gotham (Season Nine).  He also came in second in Survivor: Tortuga (season Two) and Survivor: Neverland (Season Sixteen).  Since then there have been three other double winners:   Will (Survivor: Coruscant and Survivor: Wonderland), Jake B. (Survivor: Abarat and Survivor: Dark's Pandemonium Carnival) and Aria (Survivor: Arkham Asylum and Survivor: The Commonwealth), and one triple winner: Ben (Survivor: The 10th Kingdom, Survivor: Sunnydale and Survivor: Neverland).</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: Coruscant (Season 10) became the first season in which the Final Two consisted of two members of the same family.  Will defeated his brother Ben (winner of Survivor: the 10th Kingdom) in one of the best final Tribal Councils to date.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>During Survivor: Godric's Hollow (Season 11) Adam became the first player to use the hidden Immunity Idol twice in one game.  Both times he would have been voted out without it.  He went on to win the game.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains (Season "12.5") was the first season to be by-invitation only.  From past players, the most notorious villains and the most noteworthy heroes were hand-picked to compete against one another.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>To date, only five seasons of Survivor had a final three instead of a final two -  Survivor: The 10th Kingdom (Season 8), Survivor: Sunnydale (Season 13), Survivor: Neverland (Season 16), Survivor: The Commonwealth (Season 25) and Survivor: The Barbary Coast (Season 27). Three of the five were won by Ben.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Survivor: Abarat (Season 15) was the first season to feature the Redemption Island twist.</li>
                    <li className='fact'>Jake B. became the first ever back-to-back winner of Survivor when he won first Survivor: Abarat (Season: 14) and then Survivor: Dark's Pandemonium Carnival (Season: 15). 10 seasons later, we got our only other back-to-back winner. Aria was victorious in Survivor: Arkham Asylum (Season 24) and Survivor: The Commonwealth (Season 25).</li>
                    <li className='fact'>To date, the winningest Survivor families are:â€‹
                        <ul>
                            <li className='fact'>The Anderson family with two wins between them: Kaley, winner of Survivor: Tortuga (Season 2) and Cole, winner of Survivor: The Barbary Coast (Season 27).</li>
