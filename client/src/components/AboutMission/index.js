            <p className='about-mission-p'>Skye's the Limit Studio began in 2001 with the idea that people of all ages should have a place where they can be involved in performing arts. It quickly grew into so much more. STL is a vibrant, unique, welcoming family of performers who encourage and support each other. We put on plays, musicals, concerts, special events, and even two "seasons" of Survivor (yes, just like the TV show) every year.</p>
            <p className='about-mission-p'>We offer classes and private instruction in costuming, voice, acting, and dance as well as productions for various age groups in our black box theater. During the summer months we host a full schedule of camps for ages 4-adult with performances as well as a full mainstage musical production. </p>
            <p className='about-mission-p'>It's our mission to foster a love of the arts, instill confidence, and create a positive environment for everybody who comes through our doors.</p>
